-Scope: We should aim to release with a short development time to lower publisher rebate and make it more appealing to the publisher along with riding the trend sooner than later. This will probably mean aiming to release early access with something like a 6 month development window with only a couple of game sections and core gameplay loop finished at the time. -World: Need to create a lore-bible for the world that exhibits will all reference and encourage people to theorize about the world and make it all feel more interconnected (edited)
 

-Gameplay Loop: Players will be assigned one or multiple tasks to complete as their win condition to be able to leave each night. They will divide up into their roles/jobs with the goal of completing the task. 
	-Tasks would have multiple tiers: 
	Individual Item Task: Seek out specific item, do something with that, often job-specific(example: carrying a stone idol to storage that screams when it's sitting still) 
	Exhibit Task: Places barriers or obstacles preventing someone from linearly completing a task, often requires other objects in the museum or creative solutions to bypass(example: to clean a room guarded by a living statue that reacts to loud noises, using screaming idol to lure it away) 
	Museum Level Task: A major task that would require multiple objects from different exhibit level tasks to complete and/or a sum of skills learned from item level tasks.(example: clean a possessed fossil, the fossil will eat anyone who gets to close, players have to get it to chew on the skeleton of a the possessed fossil's prey-food so it will let them clean it. But that item is in the room guarded by the living statue and is also animated and running around so players need to use another cursed artifact to immobilize it and then transport it on the janitor's cart.) 
	Ending Level Task: A significant task that would require players to utilize a number of tools and different objects around the entire museum to unlock, rewards with an ending.

In the early game, players will usually be assigned multiple individual item tasks, and later in progression they will start receiving exhibit tasks that require them to use what they learned from item tasks to complete, and then finally museum level tasks are used in the late game. 
	-Each section has multiple exhibit areas that open and close as players progress, early nights would only have one easy exhibit open and later nights would have multiple exhibits open. Each exhibit has one monster, a number of item tasks, a few exhibit tasks, and one museum level task tied to it.(Ideally multiple monsters and museum tasks if/when scope and content increase) 
	-Players need to clean the museum but it is not tied to their win condition, instead cleaning rewards them with money to buy better tools and equipment and failing to clean offers them fines. 
	-Failsafe map that functions as a normal map with a small radar around the player, active Roombas expand the radar range to show you what's near them, aiding players further after their friends die.(or a similar idea that buffs the player when other players die) 
	-Probably have some sort of permanent loss condition but make game first and then see what will feel good.

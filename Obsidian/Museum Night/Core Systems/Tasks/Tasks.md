Players are assigned one or multiple tasks they are required to complete before they can leave each night. There are multiple tiers of tasks where each tier is supposed to add a layer onto the previous, with a progression system where early in a game or after unlocking a section/exhibit they are only assigned basic tasks, then later exhibit tasks that are given based on prior basic tasks(only giving exhibit tasks that are designed for players to utilize relics they've already utilized in basic tasks), and finally they're given section tasks late into the game. 

-[[1 Basic tasks]]: These tasks will be simple and generally focused around separately interacting with one or more relics in an exhibit to introduce players to what the relics do.(ex. moving a relic from one part of the museum to another)

-[[2 Exhibit Tasks]]: These tasks will usually look similar to basic tasks in that they require some interaction with a relic, however they will present a major obstacle that require players to be creative to bypass- usually asking for the use of mechanics from other relics that they learned about doing basic tasks.(ex. move a relic but that relic summons a blind monster attracted to sound to guard it, and the relic always makes sound when it's moving. Players must use another relic that deafens sound in an area around it to keep the monster from finding them while they move it, use an even louder relic to distract it, or sacrifice a player by having them run the opposite direction screaming to draw the monster elsewhere.)

-[[3 Section Tasks]]: These will be major multilayered tasks that will usually be solved using multiple different relics, often including relics from exhibit tasks to bypass.(ex. thoroughly cleaning the room of a t-rex skull that starts screaming and trying to eat the nearest person in the room often, and needing to eat something before resting. Context clues suggest that it preys upon something that looks like the blind monster summoned by the artifact in the exhibit task ex., and so players need to move that relic into the room so that it summons the blind monster which immediately is drawn towards the noise of the t-rex skull and gets eaten, giving players a small window to clean safely.)

-[[4 Museum Tasks]]: These will be enormously complicated secret tasks, not required to ever beat a level but instead unlock an ending to the game, often using relics and knowledge across the entire museum. Likely added post-release.

The mastodon form is characterized by being large, powerful, and half-hazard. It possesses a vision cone that limits player hiding spots- seeing both low and high with multiple sets of eyes. It's strength and size allows it to easily break down barricaded doors or barrel right through any obstacles between itself and players. It's weaknesses are a difficulty turning, the need to build up momentum slowly given it's large size, and that it cannot fit in some smaller doors, corridors, and spaces like vents. It also cannot jump so might have trouble chasing players in more platform-ey sections.

This monster will serve as one of the earliest monsters in the game and the flagship monster for the vertical slice. This monster will seek to introduce players to a number of basic mechanics such as [[vision cones and hiding]] that are important to other monsters they'll encounter later in the game. This monster has three different forms it can switch between over the course of a round - [[Mastodon form]], [[Dire Wolf Form]], and a third undecided form.

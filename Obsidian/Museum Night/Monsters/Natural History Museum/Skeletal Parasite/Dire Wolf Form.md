In this form the Skeletal Parasite possesses three skeletons - a pack of of dire wolves. This form is characterized by pack behavior and caution. In this form it has a lower line of sight making high hiding spots effective, and each of the skeletons is connected via long thin nerves and tendons. This line can act as a tripwire that can alert it to players location if they step into it. The individual dire wolf skeletons won't aim to actually kill a player and might be able to individually. Instead of attacking them directly they will try to herd and surround the player with each of it's bodies before going for the kill with all 3 at once.

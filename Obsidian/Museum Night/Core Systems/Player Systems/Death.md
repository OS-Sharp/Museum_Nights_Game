Players having tools to aid one another after death, revive, or gain function when they are the last person alive could allow for longer rounds, keep players from growing bored after death, and help facilitate single player or small player counts. These features include:

-Pacts with elder gods that let players revive after death in exchange for a special task.
-[[Roombas]]
-Some kind of tool that grows in power the more Roombas there are or fewer players there are, such as a failsafe map that gives players a small radar showing what's near them and also gives Roombas a radar to expand it's range. 
-Uncertain if there should be some penalty or major loss of progress upon all players dying aside from loss of round progress.

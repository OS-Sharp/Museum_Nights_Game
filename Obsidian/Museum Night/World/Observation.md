In this world observation holds power, the strength of the [[elder gods]] derives from their unobservable nature- by remaining unobservable outside of our reality they can avoid being bound by the rules and logic of our reality. However for some strange reason observing objects of worship created in the image of the elder gods counts as observing the gods themselves, and therefor grounds those gods to the rules of this reality. This is why worship works, not because it appeases the gods but because it weakens them, they are not appeased in fact they hate their worshippers. For this reason the most powerful gods are those that are forgotten, no longer worshipped, and that is what [[The Museum]] is for.
